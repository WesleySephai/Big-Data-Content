 ## What is Big Data?
 
 • Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be easily managed, processed, or analyzed with traditional data processing tools. The term "big" in Big Data doesn't only refer to the size of the data but also encompasses its various characteristics. There are three key dimensions, often referred to as the 3Vs.

## Examples of Big Data
