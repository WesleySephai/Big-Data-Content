 ## What is Big Data?
 
 • Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be easily managed, processed, or analyzed with traditional data processing tools. The term "big" in Big Data doesn't only refer to the size of the data but also encompasses its various characteristics. There are three key dimensions, often referred to as the 3Vs.

## Examples of Big Data
 • Google Searches
 • Over 5.6 billion Google searches are conducted per day, translating to more than 63,000 searches every second.
 
 • Facebook Data
 • Facebook users upload around 350 million photos per day.
 • Every minute, approximately 300,000 status updates are posted on Facebook.
 
 • YouTube
 • Over 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.
 
 • Twitter
 • Twitter users send out approximately 500 million tweets per day.
 
 • E-commerce Transactions
 • During peak times, major e-commerce platforms can process thousands of transactions per second.

 ## Spark
• Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system that provides a fast and general-purpose cluster-computing framework for big data processing. 

• Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Apache Spark is designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to use. It enables distributed data processing for large scale datasets across clusters of computers.

## PySpark
• PySpark is an open-source Python library and one of the core components of the Apache Spark ecosystem. 

• It enables Python developers to work with Apache Spark, a distributed, high-performance computing framework designed for big data processing. 

• PySpark combines the power of Spark's distributed computing capabilities with the simplicity and versatility of the Python programming language.
